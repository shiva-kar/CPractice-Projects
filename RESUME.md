## Summary
Results-driven BCA student with strong fundamentals in C/C++ programming, algorithm design, and backend logic. Built 15+ practical applications demonstrating data-structure usage and logical problem-solving. Seeking a software engineering role where I can contribute to development projects and improve system efficiency through clean, optimized code.

## Skills
- C Programming, C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Algorithm Design, Data Structures
- Backend Logic, Programming Logic
- Tools: VS Code, Dev-C++, Visual Studio, MS Office Suite
- Foundations: Binary/Hexadecimal Systems, Logic Gates, Flowcharts

## Education
- Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), Amity University Online — 2025–Present
- Higher Secondary Education (Class XII), Deshabandhu Bidyapith HS School, Hojai — 2022–2025

## Projects
### Mathematical Problem Solver (C Language)
- Built small C programs for prime detection (range + sieve), factorial, Fibonacci, and GCD/LCM.
- Focused on clear input validation, readable output formatting, and beginner-friendly logic.

### Data Structure Implementation
- Developed practice programs for 1D/2D arrays (sum/average, transpose) and simple string processing.
- Applied clean traversal logic and basic constraints to avoid invalid input.

### Pattern Generation System
- Created classic console patterns (diamond, hollow square, number triangle) using loops and conditionals.

**Notes**
- If you want, I can convert this into a one-page PDF-friendly format (single-column, tighter spacing) and tailor it for internships vs. entry-level roles.
