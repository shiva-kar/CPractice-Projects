# Data Structures Basics (C)

Practice programs for arrays (1D/2D) and simple string operations.

## Programs

- `array_1d_sum_avg.c` — reads an array, prints sum and average
- `array_2d_transpose.c` — reads a matrix and prints its transpose
- `string_reverse_vowels.c` — reverses a word and counts vowels

## Build & Run (PowerShell)

```powershell
cd "main projects/data_structures"
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -o array_2d_transpose.exe array_2d_transpose.c
./array_2d_transpose.exe
```
